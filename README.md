Detailed description of system architecture

A software architecture is a set of principles that define the way software is designed and developed. An architecture defines the structure of the software system and how it is organized. It also describes the relationships between components, levels of abstraction, and other aspects of the software system. An architecture can be used to define the goals of a project, or it can be used to guide the design and development of a new system.

Introduction

The architecture of a system reflects how the system is used and how it interacts with other systems and the outside world. It describes the interconnection of all the system’s components and the data link between them. The architecture of a system reflects the way it is thought about in terms of its structure, functions, and relationships. In architecture, the term “system” usually refers to the architecture of the software itself, rather than the physical structure of the buildings or machinery. The architecture of a system reflects the way it is used, and therefore changes as the system is used. For example, an airport may be designed using an architecture where the control tower and departures lounge are close together in the same building, while the control tower is further away in the same airport.

Therefore, the system is always described in terms of its parts and their operations. In the same way, data is always described in terms of the elements which compose it and the operations which make it useful to an end-user. Now that we know the system and its parts, let’s dig into the data.
